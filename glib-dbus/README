Simple D-BUS client server implementation using Glib bindings.

This code implement simplest glib-dbus client/service which allows to make add/sub operations on two integers.
I found usefull to develop it following links:
http://raphael.slinckx.net/blog/documents/dbus-tutorial
http://maemo.org/development/training/maemo_platform_development_content/plain_html/

It mostly combine both sources and exclude depicated functions.
To build the project use 
make && sudo make install
to clean up system wide files use
sudo make uninstall

Use it on your wish, I will appreciate if you remember me when you think this code useful.
Consider that the code is available under the GPL v.2
